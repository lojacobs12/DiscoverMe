    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h3>We seek to create a game-based website to teach young children with physical disabilities about their growing bodies, body autonomy, consent, and the concept of sexual assault.</h3>
    <br><br>
      <h2Pillars:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Knowledge of anatomy</li>
            <li>Public vs. private spaces and body parts</li>
            <li>Healthy relationships/body positivity</li>
        </ol> 
  </div>


  <div id="Why" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Why</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>The occurrence of sexual assault towards children and adults with disabilities is significantly higher than that of the general population. 
        Informing children on topics such as consent and body autonomy at a young age can potentially be effective ways 
        to work towards the prevention of these alarmingly high sexual abuse rates.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Why is physical and sexual safety education important?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“68 to 83% of women with disabilities will be sexually assaulted in their lives” (50% higher rate than the rest of the population)</li>
            <li>Adults with disabilities are at risk of being physically or sexually assaulted at rates four to ten times greater than other adults</li>
            <li>Children with disabilities are 3.4 times more likely to be sexually abused</li>
            <li>More than 90% of people both male and female with developmental disabilities will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives</li>
        </ol>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Why is representation important?</h2>
    <p>People with physical disabilities of all ages have, on average, a lessened self-esteem and sense of attractiveness. 
        The fostering of a positive self-image and encouragement of body positivity are immensely important, 
        therefore, to combat the increased risk of depression that accompanies lack of self esteem. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Higher rates of depression in individuals with disabilities have been shown to negatively affect a person’s sexual health.</li>
            <li>Stereotyped as asexual individuals</li>
            <li>The current lack of clinical information on disability and sexual health leads to difficulties in discussing sexual health with healthcare providers. Providers often do not have ample resources to give to patients, nor do patients feel comfortable enough to ask about sexual health-related topics</li>
            <li>People with more severe physical impairments experienced significantly lower levels of sexual esteem and sexual satisfaction and significantly higher levels of sadness related to their sexual functioning.</li>
        </ol>

  <div id="Forward" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Puberty</h2>
    <p>DiscoverMe does not comprehensively cover topics surrounding sexaul health, sexulaity, safety, 
        and puberty. However, we have listed various websites that discuss these topics and provide tips for 
        parents to discuss these more mature topics with their children. Common themes of these websites include using accurate 
        terminology to describe reproductive anatomy, emphasis on consent and safety, and incorporating 
        real-life examples when discussing intimate and mature topics surrounding puberty and sexuality with children.</p>
