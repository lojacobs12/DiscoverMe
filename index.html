    <p>The Compulsive Lyres is a premier coed group at the University dedicated to performing music from multiple genres ranging from Fleetwood Mac to Gwen Stefani!
        They’re best known for winning ICCA’s in 2002.
        In a poll of the a cappella community withstanding time, the Lyres have been resoundingly considered the most fun, most attractive, and most powerful group on campus, but wait maybe you shouldn’t believe everyyythhhhing they say.</p>

    <div class = "history_pars">
    <p>The Compulsive Lyres started as the offshoot of a Greek Week Sing Team of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and Alpha Phi sorority. 
        In 1997, they became the first  Greek Week Sing Team to receive a perfect score and decided to transition their team into an a cappella group, founding ‘Greek to Mi’ in 1997.
        It was quickly discovered that both the level of commitment and musical ability needed for an a cappella group was substantially different from the level needed for Greek Week. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In January 1998, the group was reorganized and auditions were held, resulting in a group of 14 members from 10 different fraternities and sororities and a different name: "Compulsive Lyres". 
        Although the level of dedication and musical ability increased, the group's purpose remained primarily social in nature, fostering plenty of friendship and even a marriage. 
        In January 2001, the group decided that they were going to take the Lyres in a new direction. 
        The Lyres severed their formal association with the Greek system, opening the audition process to the entire campus. 
        With musical excellence as the primary goal, Lyres sought out new members. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the fall of 2001, Lyres worked hard and reaped the benefits.
        Auditions resulted in an extremely strong collection of musicians, and a fall retreat brought the group closer than it had ever been, so close, in fact, that retreats are still an integral part of the Lyres experience today. 
        Their fall concert, the 1st Annual Michigan A Cappella Festival, was a huge success, featuring 9 of the 12 active groups on campus over two nights. 
        In its first year, MAC-Fest, as it came to be called, became the largest a cappella show of the year at The University of Michigan. 
        The Lyres then went on to achieve an even greater victory in 2002 by achieving 1st place at the International Finals of the ICCAs.

    <p>This year the Compulsive Lyres has been determined to continue to create music together despite the complications and obstacles in our way.
        With the help of a new executive board position, Safety Monitor, social distancing, and masks, Lyres continues to practice three times a week outside, bundled up against the cold.
        Having spend the past semester fundraising, Lyres looks forward to recording a new EP featuring music from Fleetwood Mac, Miley Cyrus, and BORNS.
